It will come as no surprise to anyone who knows me that I **love** languages. I've formally studied **Spanish** and **Mandarin Chinese** in high school and college respectively, and I find the act of communication to be fascinating. Language is like a puzzle: if you give me the pieces, I can put them together (following some rules) to express a full range of meaning and emotion! In addition to the languages I've formally studied, I have attempted to learn over the years the following: 

- **German**: Hallo, ich kann ein bisschen Deutsch sprechen!
- **Korean**: 안녕하세요! 한국어를 좀 할 줄 알아요. 
- **Japanese**: こんにちは、日本語を勉強したいですよ。

I've also dabbled in almost anything else you can name, including **Swedish**, **Dutch**, **Welsh**, and even **Arabic**, but I'm not particularly conversant in any of them. If you feel like sharing your love of language with me, I'd be delighted to learn from you!

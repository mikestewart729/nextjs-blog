**Work Experience**

***Princeton Consultants | New York, NY***

**Consultant** (June 2023 - Present)

Senior Associate II (June 2022 - June 2023), Senior Associate (March 2021)

_Selected Project Experience:_

- Developed Solution Validation Code for several clients: aircraft schedule optimization model,
collateral allocation optimization for a large bank and aerial asset scheduling optimization
    - Worked with clients to understand business rules and requirements
    - Wrote ~2500 line python script to check Constraint Programming optimizer solution
outputs against business rules and validate the correctness of solutions from the
end-user’s perspective
    - Diagnosed and fixed bugs revealed by the solution validator in the inherited client code
and in Princeton’s own code base additions, yielding implementable schedules instead of
invalid schedules previously produced
- Created multi-page web application to view data ingestion and aerial asset scheduling model
outputs graphically, complete with page navigation and stateful display of relevant scheduling
information
    - Designed a Data Model and wrote Pre-Processing Code for scheduling optimization
model proof of concept, converting input data into usable formats quickly
        - Documented raw data from client and designed data model and schemas
        - Wrote Python code to ingest and transform data from raw to model data formats
    - Using Python (Taipy), designed and built a four-page interactive web application. Created
an intuitive interface for users to upload and view scheduling data and view and export
model output schedules
- Built predictive analytics for a physical commodities trading company increasing trader margin
on shipping of physical commodities
    - Implemented simple weighted average model to predict shipping rates and reproduced
existing client tools and identify where predictive analytics can improve over the baseline
    - Built machine learning predictive model using raw and engineered features, achieving
improved performance over the simple weighted average model and improving trader
margins
- Wrote Message Parsing Code for positive train control for a commuter railroad
    - Based on a mature interface control document (ICD), wrote clean and efficient Java code
to parse incoming train messages, allowing the application to record history of train run
and display the data to users
- Managed a small team in developing a positive train control analysis tool for a commuter railroad
    - Worked closely with the project director to ensure all deadlines met and all team work
completed on time
    - Maintained quality control records through weekly audits in accordance with client policy
    - Managed scope-creep to turn desired extra features into business development
opportunities
    - Developed training materials and user guides for the analysis tool
    - Facilitated product demonstrations to other railroads to sell the tool to new clients
- Data Analysis and Graph Algorithms for a ground-shipping client to assist in building a
truck-routing optimization model
    - Provided exploratory data analysis in Python to understand and guide Senior
Optimization Specialists in the development of an optimization model, including data
visualization
    - Implemented a topological graph algorithm to convert model output into desired format
- Developed a modernization roadmap for a forestry and land management company, detailing how
to migrate to cutting edge systems with minimal risk
    - Scheduled and interviewed 33 client subject matter experts across the client enterprise
    - Collated interview contents and developed as-is user journeys for 20 business processes
    - Facilitated ideation sessions with client participants and developed to-be user journeys
    - Distilled to-be user journeys into a detailed requirements document serving as the center
of the client modernization effort
    - Developed modernization roadmap, including build or buy recommendations and risks
with mitigation strategies, which was implemented by the client to update their systems

Lately I've been getting into Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive. Clocking in at nearly 7000 pages, it can seem like a daunting task to read. Therefore, it's fortunate that I enjoy deep, well-crafted worlds and compelling characters. 

In short, the Stormlight Archive is a grand fantasy series detailing the fictional world of Roshar facing threats from the grand to the **oh my god how can it possibly get grander-grand**. One of the reasons I find the works compelling is the world-spanning scope that also manages to be very character focused. 

Works in the Stormlight Archive (as of July 10th, 2025) and my ratings:

- **The Way of Kings**: Kaladin Stormblessed centric, great introduction to the world of Roshar (4.75/5.0)
- **Words of Radiance**: Shallan centric, probably my favorite so far, amazing plot and character beats (5.0/5.0)
- **Edgedancer**: Lift centric novella, charming and expressive (4.0/5.0)
- **Oathbringer**: Dalinar Kholin centric, featuring one of my favorite scenes in the series so far (Shallan in the theater at Urithiru) (???/5.0)
- **Dawnshard**: To be determined (???/5.0)
- **Rhythm of War**: To be determined (???/5.0)
- **Wind and Truth**: To be determined (???/5.0)

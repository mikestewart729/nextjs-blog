I started this blog as a hobby project to improve my front-end/web design skills and learn the popular Next.js framework.
I've found it both interesting and rewarding. In addition to adding a toggle-button to switch between light mode and dark mode,
a surprisingly nontrivial task beyond the basic tutorial, I envision trying the following in the future:

1. Adding a top or side nav-bar for ease of navigation to specific pages
2. Changing or playing with blog styling beyond the .css styling basics in the tutorial
3. Adding dynamic content or finding a way to incorporate more data-science workflows

Furthermore, I do intend to write more as a means of improving my writing skills. I might focus on anything that catches my interests, which could include any of the following:

- Physics, math, and science-communication, especially about my own research
- Reviews of books I've read or theater I've seen recently (truly do NOT get me started on musical theater unless you have lots of spare time)
- Practice writing in languages that I'm interested in learning
- Fun or interesting snippets from my own constructed language (conlang) projects

If you have other things you'd like to see, let me know!
